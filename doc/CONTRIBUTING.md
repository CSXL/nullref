# Contributing Guidelines
All forms of contribution welcome! Here is the process:
1. Submit an issue
2. If you have a solution, fork the repository and commit your changes
3. If you contributed to the client component, run `yarn run eslint`, If you contributed in rust, run `cargo fmt`
4. Submit a PR linked to your issue number
5. A maintainer will review your PR and approve it

And there... You just made the world a better place in five easy steps ;)
